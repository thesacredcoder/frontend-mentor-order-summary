## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

While working on this project I learnt the basics of developing a component with responsive CSS and HTML with the help of Sass.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

One thing I am still not comfortable is with Mobile-First Development. A need of the hour but I'd like to take some time to be familiar with that way doing things so I can perform better in the future.
